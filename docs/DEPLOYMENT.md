# Deployment
## Getting started
### Prerequisites
Go to  https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps
Ask access to the project https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/tec-tutores/access to kurenn@icalialabs.com or to a developer in the projectâ€™s README

Now that the prerequisites are a thing from the past now we can just commit everything to master. If you want to see how it works you should go and have a look here: [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration).


## Debugging in Production
1. Make sure you have the correct heroku remote (if not just go [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5)).

``` git remote -v ```
```
heroku	https://git.heroku.com/tec-tutores.git (fetch)
heroku	https://git.heroku.com/tec-tutores.git (push)
```

2. Do ``` heroku run rails console ```
